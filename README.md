# Trivial-Organizer
A trivial cpp program that adds sentences to a file and sorts them.
A simple lightweight way to organize your collection of books, records, video games etc.

Pre-requisites: g++ 

How to use:

Windows: Write g++ add.cpp -o add.exe in your command prompt and then add <sentence> (use _ instead of whitespaces, they will be replaced by the program) 

Linux: Write g++ add.cpp -o add in your terminal and then use it as ./add <sentence> (use _ instead of whitespaces, they will be replaced by the program)
